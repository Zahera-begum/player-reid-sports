# Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage (YOLOv5 + ResNet)

This project identifies the same players across two video feeds (e.g., broadcast and tacticam) using:
- YOLOv5 (for player detection)
- ResNet18 (for feature embedding)
- Cosine similarity (for matching players)

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Player_ReID_YOLOv5.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebook
- `broadcast.mp4`, `tacticam.mp4` â€” Input videos
- `best.pt` â€” YOLOv5 model for player detection
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python dependencies
- `player_id_mapping.txt` â€” Output file with matched player IDs

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Player_ReID_YOLOv5.ipynb
```

## âœ… Output

After running the notebook, the mapping of players between the two videos will be saved in:
```
player_id_mapping.txt
```

## âš  Assumptions

- YOLOv5 model is trained to detect players as class `0`.
- Only the first frame from each video is processed for simplicity.
